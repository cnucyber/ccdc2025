6. Splunk Web Interface Configuration for Receiving Logs (Splunk Setup)

This section provides the necessary configuration steps for receiving logs in the Splunk Web Interface.
Step 1: Log in to Splunk Web Interface

    Open a browser and navigate to http://<SPLUNK_SERVER_IP>:8000.
    Log in with your admin credentials (default: admin / changeme).

Step 2: Configure Data Inputs to Receive Logs

    In Splunk Web Interface, click on Settings (gear icon in the top-right corner).
    Under Data, select Data Inputs.
    Click Add Data and choose TCP as the data input type.
    Set the Port to 9997 (default for receiving logs).
    Under Source Type, either use the default or define custom source types like os_logs, auth_logs, etc.
    Set Index to either main or create new custom indexes (os_logs, auth_logs, etc.).

Step 3: Verify Incoming Data

    Go to Search & Reporting and use a search query to check for incoming data:

    index=os_logs | head 10

    If logs are visible, they are being received successfully.

Step 4: Set Up Alerts and Dashboards (Optional)

    In Search & Reporting, create a search like:

index=os_logs "error"

Save the search and set it to trigger an alert if it matches conditions (e.g., more than 100 errors in 1 hour).
You can also create dashboards to visualize log data.
